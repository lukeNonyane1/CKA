## Notes
For Notes, start [In the Notes Folder!](/notes) and [Core Concepts](/notes/core-concepts.md) for in depth notes. 

* [core-concepts.md](/notes/core-concepts.md) Starts with the [Core-Concepts](/notes/core-concepts.md/#core-concepts) section of the course and also goes into these topics:
  * [Scheduling](/notes/core-concepts.md/#scheduling)
  * [Logging & Monitoring](/notes/core-concepts.md/#logging-and-monitoring)
  * [Application Lifecycle Management](/notes/core-concepts.md/#application-lifecycle-management)
  * [Cluster Maintenance](/notes/core-concepts.md/#cluster-maintenance)
  * [Imperative Commands](/notes/core-concepts.md/#imperative-commands)

* [definitions-cheatsheet.md](/notes/definitions-cheatsheet.md) Is a cheatsheet that has all of the yaml definition files in it for one easy-to-access place


## Review

I would **highly** recommend this course so far because of the labs and practice exams the course comes with. Just having the notes is not nearly as helpful without getting the practice from the environments that are spun up for you as well.
